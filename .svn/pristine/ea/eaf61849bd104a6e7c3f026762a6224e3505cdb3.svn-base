				+ "Keywords: VANET; MAC; CSMA; TDMA\n" + "\n" + "1. Introduction\n" + "\n"
				+ "During the last decade, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have attracted significant interest\n"
				+ "from both academia and industry. As self-organized networks built up from moving vehicle nodes,\n"
				+ "VANET provides both inter-vehicle (V2V) communications between vehicles and vehicle-to-roadside\n"
				+ "(V2R) communications between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) [1,2]. The main characteristics\n"
				+ "of VANETs are high mobility and ample energy, which respectively lead to highly dynamic network\n"
				+ "topology and large transmission range (i.e., 500 m). In VANETs, since the nodes share a common\n"
				+ "wireless channel by using the same radio frequency, an inappropriate use of the wireless channel easily\n"
				+ "results in transmission collisions and bandwidth wasting.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Due to the high mobility of vehicles, it is challenging to design an efficient medium access\n"
				+ "control (MAC) protocol with low delay and high reliability. Several research projects, such as\n"
				+ "Fleet-Net [3], PReVENT [4], SAFESPOT [5], C2C-CC [6], and CarTALK [7] are dealing with vehicular\n"
				+ "communications. Existing proposals have developed CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)- and\n"
				+ "TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)-based MAC protocols to tackle this problem [8]. However,\n"
				+ "all of these protocols have their own strengths and weaknesses: CSMA-based MAC protocols perform\n"
				+ "well for low vehicle density, but bring about high collision in the presence of vehicle crowding due to\n"
				+ "the random backoff method, while TDMA-based MAC protocols provide deterministic delay bounds\n"
				+ "by resource reservations, but are sensitive to underlying mobility and topology changes.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Sensors 2017, 17, 338; doi:10.3390/s17020338 www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n" + "\n" + "\n"
				+ "Sensors 2017, 17, 338 2 of 17\n" + "\n"
				+ "When the vehicles move with high speed, the network topology varies rapidly, leading to\n"
				+ "ever-changing scenarios. We observe that each strategy of MAC protocols has its own role. It works best\n"
				+ "for some scenarios and encounters problems otherwise. Unfortunately, existing protocols only use one\n"
				+ "of the CSMA and TDMA strategies and try to make it work under all scenarios. In this paper, we argue\n"
				+ "that both CSMA and TDMA strategies should be used together, as they nicely complement each other.\n"
				+ "Specifically, CSMA strategy is suitable for sparse network scenarios, because the underlying random\n"
				+ "accessing strategy achieves high utilization with low channel contention. Conversely, arbitration of the\n"
				+ "TDMA strategy can provide the bounded delay (even for large vehicle crowding), but it may waste\n"
				+ "channel resources—especially at low loads when the vehicle density is small.\n" + "\n"
				+ "To demonstrate the benefits of using these strategies together, we design CTMAC—a MAC\n"
				+ "protocol that synthesizes the random accessing channel (used in CSMA-style protocols) and the\n"
				+ "arbitral reserving channel (used in TDMA-based protocols). CTMAC determines the number of\n"
				+ "backoff time slots according to the vehicle density, seamlessly switching the channel accessing strategy\n"
				+ "between CSMA and TDMA. For low vehicle density, CTMAC employs the random backoff to achieve\n"
				+ "high channel utilization, while CTMAC uses the fixed backoff to reserve channel and thus guarantees\n"
				+ "the bounded delay, even in the case of large vehicle crowding. Our contributions are as follows:\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "• We provide an extensive study to experimentally and theoretically highlight the strengths and\n"
				+ "weaknesses of existing VANET MAC protocols. We reveal the impact of vehicle density on\n"
				+ "network goodput, and demonstrate why the synthesis of CSMA and TDMA is more effective\n"
				+ "under varying vehicle density.\n" + "\n"
				+ "• We design a MAC protocol that synthesizes the strategies of random accessing channel and\n"
				+ "arbitral reserving channel. Our CTMAC protocol swiftly changes its strategy by only adjusting\n"
				+ "the number of backoff time slots, which requires little modification of MAC protocols and can be\n"
				+ "easily deployed.\n" + "\n"
				+ "• We evaluate our design on NS2 simulations. The results demonstrate that—as with CTMAC—we\n"
				+ "are able to broadly improve the network goodput of state-of-the-art MAC protocols by 45%.\n"
				+ "We also show that CTMAC outperforms other protocols in terms of delay.\n" + "\n"
				+ "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 1, we describe our design\n"
				+ "rationale. The details of CTMAC are presented in Section 2. In Section 3, we report the results of\n"
				+ "performance evaluation. In Section 4, we demonstrate existing approaches and discuss their pros and\n"
				+ "cons. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5.\n" + "\n" + "2. Motivation\n" + "\n"
				+ "In this section, we present empirical studies to show the impact of varying vehicle density, as it is\n"
				+ "very common in VANET. Then, we theoretically demonstrate that high network goodput is obtained\n"
				+ "by synthesizing the CSMA- and TDMA-based MAC Protocols.\n" + "\n"
				+ "2.1. Impact of Varying Vehicle Density\n" + "\n"
				+ "In VANET, the high mobility of vehicles leads to frequently changing network topology. For a given\n"
				+ "vehicle node, when the other vehicles move in and out of its transmission range with high speed,\n"
				+ "the vehicle density around the given vehicle node varies quickly, having a great impact on the\n"
				+ "performance of MAC protocols.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Here, we firstly use NS2 simulation [9] to show the impact of vehicle density. All vehicles are\n"
				+ "uniformly deployed. Since IEEE 802.11p [10] is the MAC-layer standard in VANETs, we chose it as\n"
				+ "the CSMA protocol and compare it with VeMAC [11] protocol, which is an enhanced TDMA-based\n"
				+ "protocol designed for VANETs. Table 1 shows the road traffic parameters and MAC protocol settings\n"
				+ "that are used for both the simulations and the following analysis.\n" + "\n" + "\n"
				+ "Sensors 2017, 17, 338 3 of 17\n" + "\n"
				+ "We compare the number of packet collisions, channel utilization, and network goodput of\n"
				+ "IEEE 802.11p and VeMAC protocols under a varying number of vehicles. The number of vehicles was\n"
				+ "increased from 5 to 50. Figure 1a shows the number of packet collisions against the number of vehicles.\n"
				+ "When the number of vehicles is only 5, the packet collision is slight for 802.11p; yet, the collision occurs\n"
				+ "frequently with the increasing of number of vehicles due to its random accessing channel. By contrast,\n"
				+ "since it coordinates the time slots of each vehicle, TDMA experiences no packet collisions throughout\n"
				+ "the test. Figure 1b shows the channel utilization of both protocols. Since the number of slots in TDMA\n"
				+ "Frame N is fixed, if the number of vehicles is less than N, the channel utilization of TDMA is degraded.\n"
				+ "Therefore, for a small number of vehicles, 802.11p obtains much higher channel utilization than TDMA.\n"
				+ "However, 802.11p is not able to provide high channel utilization for a large number of vehicles, because\n"
				+ "its heavy packet collision leads to large backoff time and channel wastage. Finally, we compare the\n"
				+ "network goodput as shown in Figure 1c. It is obvious that 802.11p achieves higher network goodput\n"

				+ "design in detail.\n" + "\n" + "3. Protocol Design\n" + "\n"
				+ "In this section, we describe the design detail of CTMAC, including how to determine the number\n"
				+ "of backoff time slots according to the vehicle density, and thus switch the channel accessing strategy\n"
				+ "seamlessly between CSMA and TDMA.\n" + "\n" + "3.1. Synthesizing CSMA and TDMA\n" + "\n"
				+ "Our design synthesizes CSMA and TDMA by using two strategies in determining its next time\n"
				+ "slot to transmit a packet. Specifically, when the vehicle density is not large, all vehicles still randomly\n"
				+ "choose the next time slot. However, for the lager vehicle density, the time slot is reserved in an arbitral\n"
				+ "manner. The operation of our design can be illustrated in Figure 4.\n" + "\n"
				+ "We first compare our design with the CSMA-based protocol under large vehicle density.\n"
				+ "The principle of the CSMA-based protocol is shown in Figure 4a, where A∼B have packets to send.\n"
				+ "In the first backoff cycle, all vehicles send their packets at their respective time slot. In the second\n"
				+ "backoff cycle, however, A and C experience packet collision since all nodes set their backoff counters\n"
				+ "randomly in window [0, CWmin] as legacy 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function/Enhanced\n"
				+ "Distributed Channel Access (DCF/EDCA). Then, they randomly reset their backoff counters in\n"
				+ "a doubled contention window in the third backoff cycle. This example illustrates the shortcoming of\n"
				+ "the CSMA-based protocol under large vehicle density. In Figure 4b, to solve this problem, our design\n"
				+ "sets the backoff counters of all vehicles to a fixed common value (i.e., the number of vehicles) after\n"
				+ "successful transmissions. Therefore, all vehicles reserve the time slot in an arbitral manner and then\n"
				+ "\n" + "\n" + "Sensors 2017, 17, 338 7 of 17\n" + "\n"
				+ "avoid the collision again under the large vehicle density. Compared with the CSMA-based protocol,\n"
				+ "our design significantly increases the network goodput by 60%.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Under small vehicle density, our design utilizes the random channel-accessing strategy, which is\n"
				+ "much more effective than TDMA. Figure 4c shows the case of TDMA-based protocol when only A and\n"
				+ "B coexist. Since TDMA-based protocols always use the fixed frame length as the backoff cycle (i.e., eight\n"
				+ "in this example) regardless of whether or not the previous transmission is successful, many time slots\n"
				+ "are wasted due to the small vehicle density. Compared with the TDMA-based protocols, our design\n"
				+ "sets the size of contention window to the minimum value (i.e., 4) after successful transmissions in\n"
				+ "Figure 4d. Therefore, under small vehicle density, our design achieves a higher network goodput\n"
				+ "by 33% than TDMA-based protocols. In the following, we describe how to synthesize the CSMA- and\n"

				+ "n∗ to differentiate the vehicle density. Then, the vehicles adjust their channel accessing strategies based\n"
				+ "on the vehicle density.\n" + "\n"
				+ "We describe our proposed backoff algorithm in the following two cases.\n" + "\n" + "\n"
				+ "Sensors 2017, 17, 338 8 of 17\n" + "\n"
				+ "• For the small vehicle density (i.e., n ≤ n∗), the backoff time slot is randomly chosen to obtain high\n"
				+ "channel utilization. For each vehicle, if the previous transmission is successful, the next backoff\n"
				+ "time slot is uniformly chosen in [0, CWmin], where CWmin is the minimum contention window size.\n"
				+ "If the previous transmission failed (i.e., the acknowledgment is not received), a retransmission\n"
				+ "is scheduled, and the value of CW is doubled at each retransmission up to a pre-determined\n"
				+ "value CWmax.\n" + "\n"
				+ "• For large vehicle density (i.e., n > n∗), the backoff procedure adopts the channel reservation at no\n"
				+ "extra cost. To prevent the vehicles from colliding with each other after a successful transmission,\n"
				+ "the number of time slots in subsequent backoff cycles is set to n, where n is the number of vehicles\n"
				+ "in the transmission range. Upon a failure of transmission due to hidden terminals, channel errors,\n"
				+ "or carrier sensing errors, the number of backoff time slots for retransmission is uniformly chosen\n"
				+ "in [0, n].\n" + "\n" + "The pseudo-code of CTMAC is shown as Algorithm 1.\n" + "\n"

				+ "readily applied, and is backward compatible with current protocols.\n" + "\n"
				+ "3.3. Implementation\n" + "\n"
				+ "We implement the design of CTMAC as adjusting its strategy according to network state. There are\n"
				+ "two key steps in our design. The first one is obtaining the number of vehicles n in the transmission\n"
				+ "range: the vehicle is required to maintain the realtime network state in an easy way with small\n"
				+ "overhead. In our design, we utilize the Beacon message as the notification. When receiving the Beacon\n"
				+ "message from its neighbour, the vehicle updates the number of nodes in its transmission range n\n"
				+ "according to the ID information in the Beacon message.\n" + "\n"
				+ "The second key step is setting the threshold value n∗. If n∗ is too large, the channel access will\n"
				+ "suffer more network collisions. In contrast, it will be too early to change to channel reservation, thus\n"
				+ "losing high flexibility and robustness. Here, we set the optimal value of n∗ as the number of vehicles\n"
				+ "when the network goodput of CSMA- and TDMA-based protocols are equal in Equations (11) and (12).\n"
				+ "Finally, we calculate the optimal value of threshold n∗ as\n" + "\n" + "n∗ = b\n"

				+ "Sensors 2017, 17, 338 9 of 17\n" + "\n" + "4. Performance Evaluation\n" + "\n"
				+ "In this section, we compare the performances of CTMAC with VeMAC and IEEE 802.11p by using\n"
				+ "NS2 simulator [9]. The simulation settings are shown in Table 1. As mentioned before, the IEEE 802.11p\n"
				+ "protocol employs a random backoff scheme. We first evaluate the basic performance under the impact\n"
				+ "of vehicle density, and then analyze the protocol performances in two VANET applications: online\n"
				+ "game and safety warning. In the simulations, each test is repeated 10 times. The average values of the\n"
				+ "test results are calculated with 95% confidence intervals. In the following, we give the performance\n"
				+ "metrics, simulation setup, and performance analysis.\n" + "\n" + "4.1. Performance Metrics\n" + "\n"
				+ "Number of Collision Events is the metric to measure the channel contention, and can be generated\n"
				+ "when several neighboring nodes decide to access and transmit their packets at the same time. When the\n"
				+ "number of collision events is small, high channel utilization is obtained.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Delay is defined as the average time from the moment when a vehicle starts trying to send the\n"
				+ "packet until the end of its successful transmission, which is a crucial factor in time-critical safety\n"
				+ "applications [12]. The faster the safety message propagates, the more efficiency the corresponding\n"
				+ "protocol achieves in terms of satisfying the urgent delay requirement of emergency application.\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "Network Goodput is defined as the fraction of the channel capacity used for data transmission.\n"
				+ "The goal of an efficient MAC protocol is to maximize the throughput while minimizing the delay for\n"
				+ "user-oriented applications.\n" + "\n" + "4.2. Basic Performance\n" + "\n"
				+ "4.2.1. Impact of Vehicle Density\n" + "\n"
				+ "We use a dynamic scenario to evaluate the basic performances under different vehicle densities.\n"
				+ "We model a straight 6400 m highway scenario where vehicles are moving on a two-way highway\n"
				+ "at different speeds. The number of nodes varies from 160 to 640, and the ratio of static nodes to\n"
				+ "motion nodes is 1:3. The average speed of vehicles’ motion is 100 km/h. In order to simulate the\n"
				+ "communication traffic, we assume each node sends data packets with 200 B size to their neighbours\n"
				+ "with the transmission rate of 100 Mbps and the transmission range of 400 m. The time slot is 50 µs,\n"
				+ "and the frame length of VeMAC is set as 100.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Figure 5a shows that for both IEEE 802.11p and CTMAC, the number of collision events becomes\n"
				+ "larger as the number of vehicles increases. When the number of vehicles is 160, almost all vehicles in\n"
				+ "the network can be accommodated, and the collision rate is extremely low. On the other hand, when\n"
				+ "they cannot be accommodated, the number of collisions rises considerably, especially for the 802.11p\n"
				+ "protocol. Compared with the other two protocols, VeMAC achieves a zero collision rate throughout\n"
				+ "the test due to its channel reservation.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Figure 5b shows the delay under different vehicle densities. Since it uses a fixed frame length as\n"
				+ "the backoff cycle, VeMAC provides a predictable bounded delay no matter how large the number of\n"
				+ "vehicles. IEEE 802.11p gets a smaller delay under light channel contention, but a lager delay when\n"
				+ "contention becomes heavy. Because it adaptively shifts the channel accessing manner according to the\n"
				+ "network state, CTMAC protocol obtains the smallest delay.\n" + "\n"
				+ "In Figure 5c, it is shown that the network goodput of CTMAC is the highest among the three\n"
				+ "protocols. When the number of vehicles is 640, the network goodput of CTMAC is about 45% and\n"
				+ "21% higher than that of 802.11p and VeMAC, respectively. This result is explained by the fact that\n"
				+ "CTMAC adjusts the channel accessing according to the vehicle density. When the vehicle density\n"
				+ "increases, CTMAC reduces the randomness in channel accessing and effectively alleviates the packet\n"
				+ "collision. On the other hand, in a lightly loaded network, CTMAC reverts to legacy random accessing\n"

				+ "Acident detection and avoidance by the dissemination of safety messages is considered as one\n"

				+ "should be broadcasted through the following vehicles (i.e., platoon). In the test of safety warning\n"
				+ "application, we modeled a car platoon of 30 cars traveling at 100 km/h with an inter-vehicular distance\n"
				+ "of 25 m. Here, we should note that the inter-vehicular distance is set as a fixed value to compare\n"
				+ "the test results of speed difference and the distance between two consecutive vehicles after stopping.\n"
				+ "Only the first vehicle is chosen as the emergency message source, which broadcasts the emergency\n"
				+ "message backward to all the following vehicles along the highway.\n" + "\n"
				+ "At a certain point, the first vehicle in front of the platoon has an accident, and its speed is quickly\n"
				+ "reduced with a deceleration of 8 m/s2. The reaction time of drivers is uniformly distributed between\n"
				+ "0.75 and 1.5 s. Drivers are assumed to brake after the reaction time if their vehicle receives a warning\n"
				+ "message, or if one of the two vehicles in front of them brakes. After braking, the vehicles decelerate\n"
				+ "at 8 m/s2 until they stop.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Figure 9 shows the speed difference between two consecutive vehicles after stopping. An accident\n"
				+ "occurred when the speed difference was not zero. Since the wireless transmission range is limited\n"
				+ "(about 300 m), the vehicles have to relay the safety warning messages by multihop broadcasting.\n"
				+ "Therefore, if the transmission delay of each hop is small, the safety warning messages could be\n"
				+ "received by the following vehicles quickly. Since adopting channel reservation under heavy contention,\n"
				+ "both VeMAC and CTMAC obtain low delay and thus effectively reduce the number of vehicles involved\n"
				+ "in a chain accident. When using CTMAC, vehicle 14 hits the preceding vehicle at a slightly lower speed\n"
				+ "than VeMAC.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Figure 10 shows the distance between two consecutive vehicles after stopping. If the distance is\n"
				+ "less than 4 m, an accident is assumed to happen. It is shown that—since it has the lowest transmission\n"
				+ "delay—the average distance in CTMAC is smaller than the other two protocols.\n" + "\n"
				+ "To evaluate the protocol performance in more realistic scenarios, we set 500 vehicles moving on\n"

				+ "Generally, MAC protocols fall into one of two broad categories: CSMA-based and TDMA-based.\n"
				+ "The CSMA-based protocols do not require any predefined schedule; each node will compete for channel\n"
				+ "access when it needs to transmit. As the standard deployed to enable vehicular communication, IEEE\n"
				+ "802.11p protocol uses a priority-based access scheme that employs both Enhanced Distributed Channel\n"
				+ "Access (EDCA) and Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanisms.\n"
				+ "However, when several neighboring nodes sense a free channel and decide to access and transmit\n"
				+ "their packets at the same time, packet collisions happen. Therefore, the IEEE 802.11p protocol does not\n"
				+ "provide a reliable broadcast mechanism with bounded communication delay.\n" + "\n"
				+ "As an enhanced CSMA-based protocol, Receiver Consensus (ReC) [13] uses geographical\n"
				+ "information to reduce the packet collision and transmission delay. In ReC, the selected receiver is the\n"
				+ "nearest vehicle to the centroid of neighboring vehicles that have not received the packet. Upon receiving\n"
				+ "the packet, the selected receiver retransmits immediately. Thus, the packet collision is reduced, while at\n"
				+ "the same time the receiver can retransmit the packet to the following vehicles without delay. However,\n"
				+ "due to the vehicle’s high mobility, there exists a great practical difficulty—ReC requires a complete\n"
				+ "and continuously updated knowledge of the neighboring vehicles.\n" + "\n"
				+ "To avoid inaccurate position estimation in a highly mobile environment, Privileged Inter Vehicle\n"
				+ "Communication Architecture, (PIVCA) [14] utilizes Hello messages to get the realtime position\n"
				+ "information of other vehicles around. With the neighbour position information, PIVCA prioritizes\n"
				+ "farther vehicles in forwarding packets. In particular, the broadcast delay is computed based on the\n"
				+ "contention window (CW) in IEEE 802.11p MAC protocols. The farther vehicle has a smaller CW,\n"
				+ "and thus will have lower waiting delay before relaying the message.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Another emerging area of research in the field of VANETs is TDMA-based MAC protocols.\n"
				+ "To avoid packet collision, the time is divided into slots, and only one vehicle can access the channel at\n"
				+ "each time slot in TDMA-based protocols. Since all vehicles use the same channel at different times,\n"
				+ "the disadvantages of the IEEE 802.11p standard is eliminated, and the time to access the channel is\n"
				+ "reduced when node density is high. However, many issues arise due to the high vehicle mobility,\n"
				+ "degrading the performances of these TDMA-based MAC protocols [15–17].\n" + "\n"
				+ "Several TDMA-based MAC protocols are proposed to address the problem in mobility scenarios.\n"
				+ "In AdHoc MAC [18], the vehicles are grouped into a set of clusters without centralized coordination.\n"

				+ "the other vehicles within its one-hop neighborhood. Upon receiving the status information, each\n"
				+ "vehicle knows the time slots used by all of the vehicles within its two-hop neighborhood and the set of\n"
				+ "accessible time slots. Then, the vehicles choose the free time slot to transmit its data, without causing\n"
				+ "any packet collisions.\n" + "\n"
				+ "VeMAC [11,19] is a multi-channel TDMA-based MAC protocol proposed for VANETs. In the\n"
				+ "control channel, the vehicle exchanges the status information of time slots with its one-hop neighbours.\n"
				+ "Then, each vehicle determines its time slot in the service channel and achieves contention-free accessing\n"
				+ "channel. However, though communications over the service channels has no overhead, the overhead\n"
				+ "of the control channel is a considerable issue.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Unified TDMA-based Scheduling Protocol (UTSP) [20] uses roadside units to collect the\n"
				+ "information, including the channel state, moving speed, and Access Category of the vehicles within its\n"
				+ "communication range, and then assigns the time slots to the vehicles. UTSP achieves high network\n"
				+ "throughput and ensures fairness between vehicles; however, it was designed to support only VANET\n"
				+ "with the roadside units.\n" + "\n" + "\n" + "Sensors 2017, 17, 338 16 of 17\n" + "\n"
				+ "Cooperative AdHoc MAC (CAH-MAC) [21] protocol is a cooperative TDMA-based MAC protocol\n"
				+ "in VANET with the aim of improving network throughput in poor channel. Upon a transmission\n"
				+ "failure, a neighboring vehicle called helper offers cooperation to relay the failed packet during an idle\n"
				+ "time slot. The shortcoming of CAH-MAC is that the helper vehicle is not able to transmit its own data\n"
				+ "when it retransmits the failed packet. Furthermore, when the free time slot is used for retransmission,\n"
				+ "the number of time slots available for newly joining vehicles is reduced.\n" + "\n"
				+ "CSMA-based protocols do not require any predefined schedule, and achieve high goodput for low\n"
				+ "vehicle density. Since there is no guarantee of successful transmission, however, CSMA-based protocols\n"
				+ "may cause problems such as packet loss and large delay for large vehicle density. TDMA-based MAC\n"
				+ "protocols work better in improving transmission reliability and reducing the delay when the vehicle\n"
				+ "density is large. However for low vehicle density, the fixed frame length increases the wasted time in\n"
				+ "idle slots, and eventually results in lower goodput.\n" + "\n"
				+ "In contrast with the enhanced CSMA and TDMA-based MAC protocols, our solution CTMAC\n"
				+ "tackles the channel accessing problem through a different perspective: we adjust the contention\n"
				+ "window by dynamically synthesizing CSMA- and TDMA-based MAC Protocols. The key difference is\n"
				+ "that existing solutions tackle the channel accessing problem with either random backoff or resource\n"
				+ "reservation, while our solution introduces resource reservation into the backoff procedure to address\n"
				+ "the dynamic scenarios with both small and large numbers of vehicles, where existing solutions\n"
				+ "become ineffective.";
